Crisis, Recession and Monetary Policy
See [[EC1101E Macro 4]]
# Financial Crisis

## Financial Innovations
New types of securities
Borrow short terms
Insurance against falling asset values
Non-bank fin. institution (NBFI)

### Securization
Ex. A bank can give mortgage loans and bundle them together. The one who owns the bundle (MBS) gets the interest of the loan

### Slicing and dicing
Slice of MBS of high risk and combine with others to make low risk CDOs

### Borrow short term
Sells CDO but agrees to buy it back shortly later at a higher price. Basically a short-term loan with the diff is interest

### Collateral for repos
Security acts as collateral: if other part doesn't follow agreement
Lenders prefer liquid and safe assets

### Credit default Swap (CDS)
Kind of insurance

### Shadow banking
NBFIs that take on short term liabilities to purchase long term assets
- Hedge funds mutual funds, etc.
Highly leveraged: > 30

## Crisis and Aftermath
- Prices of MBS's, CDOs fell drastically.
- Lenders didn't want to enter into repos or accept securities as collateral since they feared borrowers are insolvent
- Banks and NBFI's tried to deleverage but bcs everyone did the price falls drastically, leading even closer to insolvency
# The money market
- Money, financ. assets and interest rate into Keynesian
- 2 fin. assets:
	- Bonds - risky but interest
	- Money - safe but no interest
- Assume inflation rate is fixed
	- Nominal and real interest rate move together

### Money demand
amount of wealth households choose to hold as *money*
holds more money If
1. interest rate falls - opp. cost of holding money falls (Asset demand for money)
2. Price level rises - needs more money to do transactions
3. Output rises - more stuff to be bought and sold
Plotted on graph with r on y-axis and money on x-axis

### Money supply
Assume CB complete control and can choose
- curve is a vertical supply curve
- Shifts when CB wants to shift it

### How does money market clear
Buy money when sell bonds and sell money when buy bond - mirrored markets
**As bonds price goes up, interest goes down**

If r above equilibrium, thus excess supply of money and excess demand for bonds, leading to price of bonds goes up and r down. Vice versa
# Interaction with goods market
**If r rises, Y* falls**
**if Y rises money r rises**
### The return of crowding out
Crowding out now present in Keynesian
reduces the size of the expenditure multiplier

# Monetary Policy
CB actions and communications to manage money supply to influence economic activity
- To target the interest rate
Expansionary - increase Y*
Contractionary - decrease Y*

### Countercyclical MP
if Y* < Yfe use exp. and opposite
MP faster to enact and easier to reverse, thus first choice over fiscal policy

### MP affects FP
CB wants to neutralize FP

### In practise
Not a single interest rate in economy
CB targets one short-term interest rate
- Overnight - FFR
- Benchmark for other interest rates
- Things tend to move with change in FFR

# Unconventional Monetary Policy
How CB conducted MP during recession when stuff didn't work
Now almost standard

Hard for CB to have r below 0%
Bonds are not useful at all
Conven. MP stops at r=0% 

### Quantiative easing (QE) = large scalle asset purchases
CB buys lots of financial assets paying with newly created reserves
- Open market purchases on steroids
- Buys a lot lot of MBS
To boost asset prices and reduce long-term interest rates
Reduces pressure on fin. inst. to delverage
Does it induce consumption?

However, didn't really work because banks wanted to hold excess reserves.
=> Did not lead to hyperinflation

### Forward guidance
communicating future policy, e.g. keep target r at 0.25% for the extended future
meant to influence business and households expectations of the future interest rate
Was kept for 7 years so did keep their word
- Impact? got out of the recession but haven't been able to get out of the slump

### Fiscal policy is needed
Deep prolonged slumps not battled with only MP
but FP was more focused on long run so didn't work in the recession

# Monetary policy and inflation
2022 is the year of inflation!
Due to increased price of energy, wars and sanctions against Russia

### Theory of inflation: intuitive version
When nominal AE rises relative to real potneital
- in short run, economy can produce abovec potential
- Long run prices and wages rise until real AE falls back to equal real potential

### Inflation triggers: demand and supply shocks
- Positive demand shocks: increases in Expenditure
- Negative demand shocks: reduction in potential output. Can leads to stagflation: high inflation and high unemployment

### Sustained high inflation requires
- Hesistance from CB to tighten MP
- People expect high inflation

## Lessons from Volcker Disinflation
- Beating high finlation involves doing contractionary monetary policy until the job is done
- CB's credibility is important for influencing inflation expectations
- Pre-emption: best to keep inflation low and stable, rather than to let it ramp up
